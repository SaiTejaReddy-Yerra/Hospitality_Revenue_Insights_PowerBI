# AtliQ Grands Hospitality Revenue Insights

## Hospitality Domain – Data Analytics Project Challenge By Codebasics

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Codebasics Resume Challenge, aiming to provide valuable business and data intelligence insights to AtliQ Grands, a chain of five-star hotels in India. The objective is to analyze historical data and create a Power BI dashboard to help AtliQ Grands regain its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.

### Task List
You are a data analyst who has been provided with sample data and a mock-up dashboard to work on the following task.

- Create the metrics according to the metric list.
- Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard

## About AtliQ Grands

#### Some good-to-know stats before starting the building dashboard.
- AtliQ Grands is a five stars hotel chain is operating in 4 cities (Hyderabad, Mumbai, Banglore, Delhi).
- It has 7 properties with branches across these 4 cities.
- The rooms in these properties are categorized into 4 types: Elite, Premium, Presidential, & Standard.
- There are 6 main platforms to book the rooms and some other platforms that are not as effective as others.

### Datasets provided by Codebasics
- **dim_date**
- **dim_hotels**
- **dim_rooms**
- **fact_bookings**
- **fact_aggregated_bookings**

### Key Metrics to include in the Report suggested by the stakeholder

#### Financial Stats
The financial stats added in this report are the typical metrics that are used only in the hospitality sector. This includes revenue, cancellations, room-level pricing etc.

Here is a list of these financial metrics used in the hospitality industry.
1. *Revenue* - a common metric used in every industry.
2. *RevPAR* - Revenue generated per available room.
   - RevPar = Total Revenue / Total Rooms available to Sell
   - Revpar = ADR * Occupancy %
3. *ADR* – Average Daily Rate is the average daily price per room.
   - ADR = Total Rooms Sold Revenue / Number of Rooms Sold

#### Performance Stats
The stats related to performance includes the hotel’s occupancy, cancellation %, room availability and many more.

Here is a list of performance metrics used in the hospitality industry.

1. *Occupancy %*
   - Occupancy % = Total Rooms Occupied / Total Rooms Available
2. *Cancellation %*
3. *SRN* (Sellable Room Nights)
   - SRN is the metric used for available rooms that can be sold. Example: If there are 100 rooms in a hotel and 20 rooms are not available for any XYZ reason, the SRN here is 80.
4. *DSRN* (Daily Sellable Room Nights)
5. *URN* (Utilized Room Nights)
   -URN are the nights utilized by the customers. This can be the checked-in nights. It is considered when the customer ends-up staying.
6. *DURN* (Daily Utilized Room Nights)
7. *BRN* (Booked Room Nights)
    - It is the sum of URN, Cancellation and customers who didn't stay even after bookings.
    - BRN = URN + Cancellation + No Show
8. *DBRN* (Daily Booked Room Nights)
9. *Realisation*
    - It refers to the number of customers bookings received against customers actually stayed 
    - Realisation = URN / BRN
10. *Avg Rating* – Average rating is the average rating given by a customer per booking.
11. *Day Type* – Day is the category of days in a week. Weekday and Weekend. Based on the feedback from stakeholder, we considered Friday and Saturday as weekend and weekdays from Sunday to Thurdsay.
12. *Booking Platforms* – Booking platforms are the modes that are used by customers to book rooms. These include AtliQ’s own booking platform and third-party platforms as well.
13. *Week Number* – Week number is the number of weeks in a year. 
14. *WoW* – Week on Week is the metric to compare the performance change over the week.

### Mock-up Dashboard

## Steps taken to build Dashboard
#### Data Import and Transformation
- Imported all datasets into Power BI.
- Performed necessary data transformations using Power Query.

#### Data Modeling
- Established relationships between tables to create a STAR schema.
- Created calculated columns and measures using DAX.

 #### Dashboard Creation
- Designed the dashboard based on stakeholder mock-up.
- Implemented key metrics and additional insights.

### Data Transformation

#### Created calculated columns in dim_date table
1. Used DAX formula to derive week number from the corresponding date       
- wn = WEEKNUM(dim_date[date])
2. Used DAX formula to derive day type          
- day type =           
 Var wkd = WEEKDAY(dim_date[date],1)        
 return     
 IF(     
  wkd>5,"Weekend","Weekday")


### Data Model Created
